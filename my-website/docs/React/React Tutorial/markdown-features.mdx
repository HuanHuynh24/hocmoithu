# React Components

_Components_ are like functions that return HTML elements.     
_Components_ are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.   
_Components_ come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.
## Create Your First Component

When creating a React component, the component's name MUST start with an upper case letter.
### Class Component
A class component must include the <span>extends React.Component</span> statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a <span>render()</span> method, this method returns HTML.
``` js title="Example"
//Create a Class component called Car
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

```
### Function Component
Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.
```js title="Example"
// Create a Function component called Car
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}
```
## Rendering a Component
Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns an <span> `<p>` </span> element.

To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: <span> `<car />` </span>
``` js title="Example"
// Display the Car component in the "root" element:
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);
```
## Props
Components can be passed as <span>props</span>, which stands for properties.   
Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.   
You will learn more about <span>props</span> in the next chapter.
```js title="Example"
// Use an attribute to pass a color to the Car component, and use it in the render() function:
function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a {props.color} Car!</h2>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car color="red"/>);
```
## Components in Components
We can refer to components inside other components:
```js title = "Example"
// Use the Car component inside the Garage component:
function Car() {
  return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
      <Car />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);
```
## Components in Files
React is all about re-using code, and it is recommended to split your components into separate files.   
To do that, create a new file with a <span>.js</span> file extension and put the code inside it:
```js title="Example"
// This is the new file, we named it "Car.js":
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}

export default Car;
```
To be able to use the Car component, you have to import the file in your application.
```js title="Example"
// Now we import the "Car.js" file in the application, and we can use the Car component as if it was created here.
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import Car from './Car.js';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);
```
